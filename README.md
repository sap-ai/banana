<img src="istock-162487071.jpg"></img>
<p>To change the, ip, and port, you must change the host's values to change the ip in db.py, and you must change the port value to change the port in db.py, run db.py to activate the db.</p>
<p>To use this curl the url with the ip, and port, then add the comand and /%, and after that add the content(a word only) you want to do to the data base.</p>
<p>How you can help is by forking this repo to make your own better databases.</p>
<p>This database was made in a day.</p>
<p>Comands are r you remove the number location of a value removing the value, a you add a value to the database.</p>
<p>The command is is a sepcial comand because you have the number location, then add a % with the value you want to swap the locations value out with.</p>
<p>This was built in python 3.11.</p>
<p>The adding to the database uses spaces between the text now.</p>
